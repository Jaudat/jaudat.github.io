I recently graduated from University of Toronto with a degree in Computer Science and am currently working at IBM Toronto. 

### More Information

This blog is my attempt to make what I read "stick", by using the Feynman Technique(https://www.quora.com/How-effective-is-the-Feynman-technique-for-learning). For those who do not know here are the basic principles of it:

1. Choose a Concept
2. Teach it 
3. Identify Gaps and Go Back to The Source Material
4. Review and Simplify

This blog will mostly contain my summary notes as I try to simplify and explain various concepts that I feel are worth knowing about to become a better software engineer.
